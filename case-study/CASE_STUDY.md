# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
There can be several challenges for tracking and allocating costs, some of the main challenges are mentioned below:
  A. Cost Types:
    1. Transportation Cost(Fuel, delivery, distance, weight, tolls)
    2. Labor cost (Salary)
    3. Inventory cost (storage, damage, expiry)
    4. Machine cost required for inventory handling (maintenance, repair, replace)
    5. Overhead expenses like rent, deposit, electricity
    Some of the above costs are fixed but others are on need/urgent basis which can impact overall cost estimates.
  B. Demand changes:
  During sales, festive season there can be surge in demand or during some unforeseen circumstances like natural calamities there can be drop in demand which can be unpredictable.
  C. IT/Software Cost:
  IT support/maintenance issues like if data among different systems are not in sync or delays can impact chain of events and incur additional costs which might also impact delivery/inventory/transportation.
  D.Shared Resource:
  One delivery truck might deliver to multiple stores.
  Warehouse staff may handle multiple products.
  Above factors might make it difficult to divide the exact cost per store or per product.


## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**

To optimize fulfillment costs without reducing quality, below approach can be followed:

1. Cost estimation factors:

Analyze spend on labor, inventory, warehousing, transportation, packaging, and technology.
Use data analytics to find inefficiencies (e.g., excess inventory, underutilized assets, high shipping costs).
2. Potential Cost Optimization Strategies:

Inventory Management: Improve demand forecasting, reduce safety stock.
Automation: Use automation for repetitive tasks to reduce manual labor and human errors.
Smarter shipping routes: Optimize delivery routes
Energy Efficiency: Implement energy-saving measures (LED lighting, smart HVAC).

3. Prioritize Strategies:

Estimate cost savings, implementation complexity, and impact on service quality for each strategy.

4. Implement & Monitor:
Involve stakeholders in planning and execution.
Monitor results, adjust as needed, and scale up as required
Expected Outcomes:

Reduced labor, inventory, and transportation costs.
Improved operational efficiency and productivity.
Maintained or improved customer satisfaction and service levels.


## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Improved Decision Making with reliable data
Help in accurate reporting and compliance
Provides real time cost visibility
Avoid manual data entry and errors
Better tracking of budget vs actual expenses
Reduced data mismatch between operations and finance.

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Budgeting and forecasting help the company for below factors:
	1.	Helps to predict future costs
	2. 	Allocate resources efficiently
	3. 	Improved profitability
	4.  Predict future operational costs
	5. 	Plan warehouse capacity and manpower
I would consider below factors into designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting
	1. Historical data Analysis: To identify trends and patterns like labor cost trends, transportal cost variations, seasonal inventory fluctuations
	2. Cost Categorization: Break down cost into fixed cost, variable cost, one time/maintenance cost
	3. Automation & Dashboards: Implement real-time dashboards, trends like Cost per product, cost per warehouse, cost per year.
	4. Actual vs planned : Track Budgeted vs Actual, forecast vs actual, and root cause of these differences.

## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
Below factors make it important to preserve cost history:
1. Help in comparing old vs new warehouse performance, issues
2. Helps to identify past cost trends and inefficiencies.
3. Prevents loss of historical financial data.
4. Maintain financial audit and compliance records.
And it helps to keep the new warehouse operation within budget in below ways:
1. Identifying areas where cost can be optimized.
2. Helps detect overspending early.
3. Past cost data helps set realistic budgets.
4. Helps to analyze budget vs actual amount

## Instructions for Candidates
Before starting the case study, read the [BRIEFING.md](BRIEFING.md) to quickly understand the domain, entities, business rules, and other relevant details.

**Analyze the Scenarios**: Carefully analyze each scenario and consider the tasks provided. To make informed decisions about the project's scope and ensure valuable outcomes, what key information would you seek to gather before defining the boundaries of the work? Your goal is to bridge technical aspects with business value, bringing a high level discussion; no need to deep dive.
